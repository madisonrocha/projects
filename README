Project 1: Automated Elkstack Deployment
The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA. Load balancing ensures that the application will be available, in addition to restricting access to the network. Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs and system files.

Project 2: Security Engineer for SOC Infrastructure
The objective of this project was to act as a security engineer supporting a SOC infrastructure, looking at discrepancies with alerting in Kibana systems, and fixing any issues found. Alerts were configured to detect unusual activity, followed by a CTF on the machines to test the alerts. Both an offensive red  team and defensive blue team analysis were performed, as well as a network analysis. Suggestions were then made on how to harden the system.
